# Fall 2023 Internship Workshop

Hello and welcome to the invitation to participate in the DTS Internship workshop.  Students that are awarded this internship will be developing applications in a low-code/no-code environment. That means, no prior programming experience is necessary; however, you need to have Junior or Senior status in order to be considered.  You also must have a strong desire to participate.

During this workshop, you will learn what the internship is about. You will hear from students that participated in the internship last semester and see what kinds of projects that they created. You will also be introduced to the development environment and given a sample project to complete.

This year the workshop will be held in:

        Smith 107
        August 7, 2023
        5-8 pm


In order to participate in the workshop, you must self-enroll in the canvas course at the following link: `https://utahtech.instructure.com/enroll/9RG4YG`.
